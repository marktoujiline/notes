# Chapter 7 Challenges

1. Can we turn Maybe type constructor into functor by defining `fmap _ _ = Nothing`?
    * No, it violates identity (see 10_Functor.md)
2. Prove functor laws for reader functor.

Identity
```
fmap(id)
```
3. Implement reader functor.

4. Prove functor laws for list functor. Assume laws are true of tail part of list you're applying it to (induction)
