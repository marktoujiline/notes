# Chapter 5 Challenges

1. Show terminal object is unique up to unique isomorphism.

Definition of a termainl object is an object that has 1 incoming arrow from every other object.

```graphviz
digraph {
    b -> a
    c -> a
    d -> a
}
```

Let's assume that terminal object is not unique. That means that there is another object that has arrows from other objects.

```graphviz
digraph {
    b -> a
    c -> a
    d -> a
    b -> e
    c -> e
    d -> e
}
```

But to be terminal object, they must also have arrows coming from each other.
```graphviz
digraph {
    b -> a
    c -> a
    d -> a
    b -> e
    c -> e
    d -> e
    a -> e
    e -> a
}
```
The arrows between a and e are isomorphisms since their composition is identity. This proves that any two terminal objects are isomorphic. We also know that isomporphism must be unique as a terminal object can only have 1 incoming arrow.

2. What is product of two objects in poset (partially ordered set)? Use universal construction.

Partial order:
* Reflexive: every element is related to itself
* Transitive: if a R b and b R c, then a R c
* Antisymmetric: if a R b and b R b, then a == b

```graphviz
digraph {
    c -> a [label=p]
    c -> b [label=q]
    "c'" -> a [label="p1"]
    "c'" -> b [label="q1"]
    "c'" -> c [label=m]
}
```
Let:
* a = 1
* b = 2
* c = 3
* c1 = 4

and morphism means is >=. Both c and c1 are bigger than and b, but c is the smallest number bigger than both of them.

3. What is a coproduct of two objects in poset?
In above poset, coproduct would be greatest number that's smaller than _a_ and _b_. Also, it's the product in the opposite category.

4. Implement Either as generic type.
```
trait Either[+A, +B]
case class Left[+A](a: A) extends Either[A, Nothing]
case class Right[+B](b: B) extends Either[Nothing, B]

val fun = (aOrB: Either[Int, String]) => "hi"
fun(Left(5))
fun(Right(""))
```

5. Show Either is better coproduct than int with:
* int i(int n) { return n; } 
* int j(bool b) { return b ? 0: 1; }

Either is a better coproduct is there exists a function m from Either to the above

```
def m(intOrBool: Either[Int, Bool]): Int = {
    case Left(n) => n
    case Right(b) => b ? 0 : 1
}
```
```graphviz
digraph {
    Int -> Either
    Bool -> Either
    Int -> Intij [label=i]
    Bool -> Intij [label=j]
    Either -> Intij [label=m]
}
```

c1 is int with i and j functions. c is Either. Since there is a way to map from Either to int with projections, Either is "better" coproduct.

6. Why can int with projections not be bettern than either?

Need to show there doesn't exist a unique morphism from Intij to Either
```
case class Intij(n: Int) {
    def i(n: Int) => n
    def j(b: Bool) => b ? 0 : 1
}

def mPrime(intij: Initij): Either[Int, Bool] = {
    case 0 => /* Not sure if came from i(0) or j(true) */
    case 1 => /* Not sure if came from i(1) or j(false) */
    case n => Left(n)
}
```

7. What about these projections?
```
int i(int n) {
    if (n < 0) return n; return n + 2;
}
int j(bool b) { return b ? 0: 1; }
```

```
def mPrime(intij: Initij): Either[Int, Bool] = {
    case 0 => Right(true)
    case 1 => Right(false)
    case n => Left(n)
}
```
Since there exists a unique function m', then Either and Intij would both be coproducts, meaning they are isomorphic.

8. Come up with inferior coproduct that has multiple morphisms to Either.

```
int i(int n) {
    if (n < 0) return n; return n + 3;
}
int j(bool b) { return b ? 0: 1; }

def mPrimeOne(intij: Initij): Either[Int, Bool] = {
    case 0 => Right(true)
    case 1 => Right(false)
    case 2 => Right(true)
    case n => Left(n)
}

def mPrimeOne(intij: Initij): Either[Int, Bool] = {
    case 0 => Right(true)
    case 1 => Right(false)
    case 2 => Right(false)
    case n => Left(n)
}
```
