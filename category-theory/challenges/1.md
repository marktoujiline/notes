# Chapter 1 Challenges

1. Implement identity function
```
def identity[T](a: T): T = a
```

2. Implement composition function
```
def compose[A, B, C](f: A => B, g: B => C): A => C = (a: A) => g(f(a))
```

3. Write program that tests compose respects identity
```
def addOne(n: Int): Int = n + 1
val testIdentityOne = compose(identity[Int], addOne)
testIdentity(5) == addOne(5)
```

4. Is world wide web a category?
To be a category, you need:
* Objects: a webpage with a link
* Morphisms: a link on a webpage to another page
* Associative Composition: for webpages A, B, C:
    * Composition: If A links to B, and B links to C, you can go from A to C.
    * Associativity: Following link AB, then combining the link of BC and CD is the same as combining link AB and BC, then following CD.
* Identity: each webpage can contain a link to itself

YES

5. Is Facebook a cateogry with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?
To be category, you need:
* Objects: people
* Morphisms: friendships
* Associative Composition: for people A, B, C:
    * Composition: If A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, A is not necessarily friends with C.
* Identity: you cannot be friends with yourself

NO

6. When is a directed graph a category?
* When every node X has an edge going from X to X
* When every pair of nodes that have a path between them A, B also have a direct edge from A to B
